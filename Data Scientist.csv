We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

4.3",Data Scientist I,"Saint Louis, MO","The laboratory of Dr. Christopher Topp at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center is a plant root phenomics lab, innovating uses of 3D imaging modalities to investigate roots and their environment. We are seeking someone interested in plant biology and data analysis to help process and measure digitized plant samples using both external and internal analysis tools. Many of our projects involve high-throughput phenotyping. As such, a desirable candidate would be capable of writing reusable, efficient, and well-commented code. The successful candidate will be organized, independent, creative, have strong communication skills, desire to learn, and work with outstanding collaborative capability.

Much of the data in our lab are 3D reconstructed volumes from our large-format X-ray Tomography (XRT) system and X-ray microscope (XRM) system, but we handle a variety of other types of data depending on the project (e.g. genomics data, PET images, hyperspectral images). Given the size and variety of data in the lab, this job involves maintaining a robust computational infrastructure–including dedicated workstations, storage and processing servers, virtual machines, internal code bases, third-party software licenses, VR systems, databases, and data management. The role allows for creativity and autonomy in the design and development of tools and procedures.
